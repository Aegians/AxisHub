### DISCLAIMER
**The UI works completely fine, just these shit free lua executors cannot handle the drawing library since it's heavily based on synapse's drawing api.**


At most electron and krnl might be aple to run this script, even then its iffy. I'll patiently wait for synapse v3 or scriptware v3 to fully debug and optimize the script even more, but for the time being i'm currently unable to currently properly test the UI without it constantly breaking or the ESP breaking.
