**Updates**

v1.3
-Fixed ESP
-Overhauled a bunch of shit for obfuscation (May take a few seconds longer)
-Adjusted TPS aimbot to work properly, smoothness 5 > too strong, smoothnes 1 > perfectly locks; may need to tweak it a bit to fit your adatpability. 
-UI library is currently patched in Rolve Games (Arsenal & CBRO), highly suggest you not to use it or you will be banned.

**Future Updates**

May update UI Library in the near future,
I plan on fixing the ESP and Aimbot to work on games such as Bad business, phantom forces, and Arsenal.
